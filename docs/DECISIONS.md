# Decisions — odin-spelling

Settled choices. An entry that stops being true is rewritten, not appended to.

## 1. Generated, not hand-written

The bindings are generated with runic from the headers Amber ships, so a library bump is a
regeneration. Hand fixes are the exception and are tracked in [PATCHED.md](PATCHED.md).

## 2. Parameters are single objects unless declared

runic 0.8 writes `[^]T` for a pointer parameter whose C name ends in `s` (`settings`, `lines`),
however many elements it holds, which lets a caller index past one element, and drops a trailing
`va_list`, binding the procedure as `#c_vararg ..any`. Amber's runic fork (branch `amber-patched`)
has `parameters: declared`: with it every procedure parameter is `^T` (`T **` is `^^T`) unless
`arrays:` in the package's `rune.yml` lists it, chosen against the C headers, and a va_list
procedure is skipped. Struct members, variables and typedefs keep runic's name guess, and the
parameters of function-pointer types are plain `^T`: a limit of the fork, true in every binding.
Where a binding needs it, the `param_rules` table in `postprocess.sh` restores the `[^]` for
those parameters' real arrays, rewrites single-object struct members and corrects `T ***` outs;
a row that matches nothing fails the build. Rejected: rewriting the output in `postprocess.sh`,
which had to be told each parameter, matched `va_list` procedures by name pattern (it deleted
`list_store_insert_with_values` for containing `_va`) and was a second place to keep in step
with the headers. `scripts/check-generated.sh` stays as the guard that any regeneration, with
any runic, keeps the listed parameters right.
